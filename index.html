            <section>Why I went out of my comfort zone
                <aside class="notes">
                    I had been coding for some 23 years or so, only 17 of those I actually got paid to write code.
                    I started getting paid when I worked at a PC helpdesk, this was during the home PC era 1998 or so.
                    Me and a colluge got really fed up with the totally crappy software we hade to use so we made Züper
                    App. Saved us tones of time each day, but the code was not so super. It did work however,
                    We managed to talk around the house and could have all the serialnumbers of all computers delivered,
                    before they where delivered and not 3 days later. Since people tend to call on the same day, that
                    was a huge time saver, now we could search by name instead having to manually type in all
                    information in our support system.
                    With the press of a button it would login to Posten (port-nord) and fill in all the forms to pick up
                    a PC as someones house. And so on. Really super for us. But very small system and not official in
                    any way.
                    Did not stay there for to long since the PC sales where going down and I was (am) a bit of a schmuck
                    I had a fall out with the boss and resigned in a meeting without any idea of what to do next.

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>I had a friend who had started a company just a year before, so I called him up and begged him to
                        take me on board or if he begged me.<br>
                        So know we had a 2 man shop, we where supposed to do to WAP applications, this was at the time
                        when mobile phones could not deal with html.<br>
                        WAP was super hot so the company was called WAPNET.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However we needed money so we ended up doing a booking system for Julgalan.
                        They had been using Excel to keep track of all tickets, all food, invoices and extras and then
                        make seeting arrengements.
                        After the first year it was quite obvous it would not work, but Micke being somewhat of a sheep
                        dude didn’t want to pay big money so we did it for what we thought was a huge amount of money,
                        it wasn’t..
                    </p>
                    That system was not super great either, code wise.
                    Written in Delphi with a SQL server, It did work however and the users where happy.
                    We handled maybe 50-100 000 people each year in the system. With invoicing integrations and all.

                    One thing lead to another and soon we had a booking system for restaurants and 12 years later we had
                    over 300 restaurants in Sweden and Norway using our system.
                    By this time I of course knew every pattern in the GOF book, oop, Union architecture and what not.
                    I had no problem making our software do what we wanted.
                    After 12 years together I left the company, the company was sold of to our biggest competitor and
                    became their premium product.

                    I then worked at DGC, Movestic and Qliro. <br>
                    The whole time writing the normal C# enterprice web api stuffy that you all write every day. But it
                    was itching.. <br>
                    We did manage to get stuff out, stuff worked. But stuff took a long time and was very often overly
                    complicated. <br>
                    Or so I felt. <br>
                    When I did follow “they way to do things” ™, it was 8 interfaces and 9 classes just to check if two
                    headers values matched the values in a SQL database. <br>
                    You know we have to follow SOLID, make sure we can unit test every thing. And follow all the rules
                    to make your system maintainable.<br>

                    Before you know it you have applications that look like this. <br>
                    And the only way to not end up here is to always think about everything in the last picture and even
                    more. <br>
                    But don't follow everything all the time, only when it is appropriate otherwise you end up here as

                    Why does this happen all the Time? <br>
                    What is it that we are really doing? Are we really using the right tools for the job? <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this time I hade been playing with Akka and NSB and Event sourcing. <br>
                    I started to feel that there surely must be better ways to do stuff<br>

                    I mean we can absolutely build to kind of software we do today with C#<br>
                    But are there any alternatives? <br>

                    I only have some 30 minutes for this talk so I won't do any kind of deep dive in to all kinds now. <br>
                    But I think we all agree that machine code and Assembler is not the most efficient way to deliver value for us.<br>
                    I would also argue that even if we say that we doo OOP. We don't really do that. Because it is not a good fit. for us. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, we use classes and objects. But how much of our code is services, handlers, controllers and all other strange kind of things. <br>
                        And since we usually want to load balance and because threading is hard, we really on our databases to be the one place where the actual truth is.<br>
                        Backend code, mostly just take som request and transfers it either to and from a database, or to another system. <br>
                        The truth is not in our systems. <br>

                    Does really OOP help us here? And is it really OOP?<br>
                    For sure not they kind of OO that Alan Kay has been talking about. <br>
                     
                     This could just be called Anemic models or with some fantasy it could be Active Records, and with alot of fantasy it could be called Domain driven design<br>
                     It is very hard from all points in this program to get an idea of what will happen. <br>
                     Authentication is probably not done this way, instead in some filter thingy function you have to know about. <br>
                     The mapping is done with Automapper so you don't have to mess upp all the time. But that is hidden away somewhere else<br>
                     Then we must think if DRY, so all validators and authenticators and services and what not are all quite big classes. <br>
                     That deal with input from many places, reuse you know. <br>
                     But what happened to Single Responsibility then? <br>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     This is just procedural but with objects and classes as a way to hide functionality and maybe some state, but mostly to group different functionality together. <br>
                     Invoice 56 could be fetched by many clients at the same time, and all request would be dealt with this way. <br>

                    We took some input and did something and returned something else. <br>
                    Not a very tricky concept. I mean that is how must methods work in c#?!<br>
                    And yes, you can write code like this in C#. <br>
                    But c# offers you so many possibilities to write it in so many other ways. <br>
                    And it is very easy to cheat, and make it hard and difficult.<br>. 
                    You see. It says a to b. 
                    Not A cobbled with some state to nothing. <br>

                Keeping track of state. <br>
                or<br>
                Side effects is a pain!
                <aside class="notes">
                 <p>
                     So many of our difficulties comes from unwanted side effects. <br>
                     In a imperative language like c# when calling a method on a object. <br>
                     There is not way to determine if it changed some internal state on the object so that the next time i call it something else will happen. <br>
                     Mostly not a problem, but just the fact that this is they way it is. <br>
                     Makes it much harder to both test and reason about the system. <br>
                     Since this talk is mostly about backend stuff, and I just explained that we don't need state in our backend. <br>
                     State lives in the database. <br>
                     Would it not be much easier then to use functions that gives the same result with the same input? <br>
                     Then we can always run unit tests on those. <br>
                     Yes, this breaks when we call the database. This is where the dreaded monad comes in. <br>
                     But fear not. F# is not as strict as Haskell.<br>
                     It is actually perfectly fine to write code with side effects such as reading from disk or databases. <br>

                What about errors? <br>
                Expected vs Unexpected? <br>
                <p class="fragment">
                    Should the validator service throw an exception?<br>
                    When calling the database, how do we now if the error was temporary or permanent?<br>
                </p>

                    try

                        Logger.Exception(..)

                 <p>
                    There is no easy way to differentiate Expected from Unexpected Errors. <br>
                    There is a difference between invalid input and memory fault. <br>
                    When we do HTTP APIs, we have the 400 and 500 Errors. <br>
                    But in our code we have no satisfactory way to deal with it.<br>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Exceptions work fine for fatal stuff that we can't recover from. <br>
                    I have rarely seen code bases with what one could call correct Exception handling<br>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     This is not a way to deal with errors! 
                     Only catch them at the appropriate place. Where you can deal with it. <br>
                     But where is that?

                        Would it be possible to take this even a step further. <br>
                        And still have the strict a to b kind of functions. <br>
                        But also deal with errors? <br>
                        Sure is!<br>
                        I mean this is possible in c# as well. Just that it's not natural in the language and you have endless possibilities to fuck up. <br>
                        Parse input, and if the result was successful call validate access. <br>
                        if validation went well take the result of that and get the invoice<br>
                        If we got the invoice serialize the response. <br>
                        If any of the above went wrong, serialize an error response instead. <br>

                        This is how it would look like in F#, often though the developers would create a new operator and write it |>><br>
                        Or similar. 
                        The ParseInput should be a pure function with no calls to any databases or such and could hence easily be tested with unit tests. 
                        The validateAccess and getInvoice would probably not be. <br>
                        Since F# is a strictly typed system. Much stricter then C#. <br>
                        You would know that the code above works when compiling. Not the individual functions.  but the contracts between them.<br>
                        There is no such thing as null. No more null checks. As long as you stay in f# land and don't call c# stuffy. <br>

                        Look at the code above. It is almost like a base class with two subclasses. Or maybe more like an enum with two classes as values.<br>
                        This is a union type, or sum type. <br>
                        You could of course do this with inheritance. Have a base class and then make subclasses that are either success or error. <br>

                        This is what the function would look like in F#. <br>
                        Expect you don't have to type in the type declarations, since the compiler figures that out. <br>
                        So it takes a regular string as input and returns either Ok InvoiceRequest or Error ExcpectedError<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then our super duper validateAccess gives access to anyone. Except if they try to get hold of invoiceId Hidden.. <br>
                        But this function takes a "normal" input and return a Result type.

                        This is how it is used. <br>
                        Here the Error.bind takes two arguments. first a function that takes a InvoiceRequest and returns Result InvoiceRequest, Error ExpectedError. <br>
                        The second argument must be a Result Ok InvoiceRequest, Error ExpectedError. 
                        If the second argument is OK a it calls the function with A. If the input was an error it just returns the error without calling the function. <br>

                            It is somewhat confusing in the begining, or at least it was for me. <br>
                            And yes you can do this in c# as well. <br>
                            It's just that the code gets very messy<br>

                            It can be either or this errors. But only one of them. 
                            And as you see. One of the options can even hold values. If we need it to.

                        This is why it is so super cool with union types<br>
                        To actually get the value of it we have to switch on it. That is the match e with. <br>
                        And in this case we return a tuple of int string. 
                        Then since it is not open like inheritance where you could dynamically load a new class that inherits from the base class. <br>
                        The compiler will actually warn us (or error if we prefer) when we are missing a case. <br>
                        So it is safe to add a new option to the ExpectedError type and still know for sure you have caught all cases where it is needed.<br>

               Backend only? 
               <p class="Fragement">No, not at all.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        I Actually started to look into functional programing because of FE code. <br>
                        I looked at React, liked the MVU ide. Found it to exhausting and to much ceremony and started to code with elm. <br>
                        Now I haven't done to much in ELM. But it was easy to getting started and I did some smaller sites in it for fun. <br>
                        Then I went over to f#. Mostly because I had some backend stuff to do. It was hard<br>
                        Really hard to get started in F#. <br>
                        I mean I had coded for 20+ years and then I couldn't do much more then Hello World. <br>
                        I had to read books, view presentations and read blogs<br>
                        Still it took me several months before I code write a bit more complex things<br>
                        But you guys have a much better position if you are having the same feeling of trying to find another way to express your code as I did<br>
                        We have 2 departments with several team writing f#. So if you get stuck, or just want to know more reach out to any of them or me. <br>
                        And you will have a much faster learning cure. <br>
                        If you like me, only have dune procedural code, it will change the way you look at code to the better.<br>
                        Even if you keep writing c#<br>

                     <aside class="notes">
                         It is most often easier to write expressive but still easy to follow code.<br>
                         But it is easy to get lost in endless discussion about Monads and functors and what not.<br>
                         The biggest benefit is that it makes it easier to write good code and harder to write bad code<br>
                         But of course not nearly impossible to write bad code.<br>
