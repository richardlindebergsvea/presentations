                <section>Why I went out of my comfort zone
                    <aside class="notes">
                    I had been coding for some 23 years or so, only 17 of those I actually got paid to write code. 
I started getting paid when I worked at a PC helpdesk, this was during the home PC era 1998 or so. Me and a colluge got really fed up with the totally crappy software we hade to use so we made Züper App. Saved us tones of time each day, but the code was not so super. It did work however, 
We managed to talk around the house and could have all the serialnumbers of all computers delivered, before they where delivered and not 3 days later. Since people tend to call on the same day, that was a huge time saver, now we could search by name instead having to manually type in all information in our support system. 
With the press of a button it would login to Posten (port-nord) and fill in all the forms to pick up a PC as someones house. And so on. Really super for us. But very small system and not official in any way. 
Did not stay there for to long since the PC sales where going down and I was (am) a bit of a schmuck I had a fall out with the boss and resigned in a meeting without any idea of what to do next.

                    <aside class="notes">I had a friend who had started a company just a year before, so I called him up and begged him to take me on board or if he begged me. So know we had a 2 man shop, we where supposed to do to WAP applications, this was at the time when mobile phones could not deal with html. WAP was super hot so the company was called WAPNET. However we needed money so we ended up doing a booking system for Julgalan. They had been using Excel to keep track of all tickets, all food, invoices and extras and then make seeting arrengements. After the first year it was quite obvous it would not work, but Micke being somewhat of a sheep dude didn’t want to pay big money so we did it for what we thought was a huge amount of money, it wasn’t..  That system was not super great either, code wise. Written in Delphi with a SQL server, It did work however and the users where happy. We handled maybe 50-100 000 people each year in the system. With invoicing integrations and all. 
                        One thing lead to another and soon we had a booking system for restaurants and 12 years later we had over 300 restaurants in Sweden using our system. By this time I of course knew every pattern in the GOF book, oop, Union architecture and what not. I had no problem making our software do what we wanted. After 12 years together I left the company, the company was sold of to our biggest competitor and became their premium product.
